  In game system, there are four types of thinking. Linear thinking, reductionist thinking, holistic thinking and systemic thinking. 
Reductionist thinking is seeing something as a part. These type of thinking often ignore the interaction feature, and it is overapplication
. Holistic thinking is seeing something as its whole, Holistic is the effective opposite of reductionism, this type of thinking ignores the
details that cause effects in the whole, reductionism is about analysis, holism is about synthesis. The linear thinking is similar to a 
line, it sees everything in simple cause, system thinking is combining reductionist and holistic.
Linear thinking is like playing a game without reading any rule, you just play the game by itself and seeing everything in simple cause. 
  This can work but the experience you have by playing that game will be minimum. The system thinking combine feedback of player and chaos, 
the interactive scene with player will show up many times in a game. The system thinking is the correct way a game should be played. The system thinking need to find and understand each part of the system works, and how can it connect to the whole.
When playing Formula D in a linear thinking way, the player just role the die and move the car to the finish line, one player role the die 
and next player role the die, this feel kind of boring. Without any interactivity and feedback player is like a computer, following the command and play the game. From the linear point of view, it provides player the experience of competition, the first one that cross the finish line win, it’s simple but the game you play is based on luck, the one who roll the largest die win. Anyone can play it but they cannot experience how the game actually work and have fun. The most important one is that this game is a car racing game, not a rolling die game. Imagine you are driving a car and race with other player; this is the experience that the game designer wants you to have.
  When playing Formula D in a system thinking way, it provides player not only a better experience of this game but also provides player the 
thrilling of a race. The system is made of parts, loops and wholes. From a system point of view, player will be affected by other condition
in the game, when you driving into corner you need to slow it down to avoid driving out of the lane, there are 6 gear in the game and you 
can rise it or low it down, you can only lower 1 gear at a time but you can use your WP to skip 1 or 2 gear, WP is like the health and if 
you lose all of your health you are out, and if you next to or behind someone else car there will be a possibilities that you will have a 
collision. this is the loops that this game has, every decision a player made can affect another player, this is the sub-systems of the 
game and it’s important. From a system perspective, Formula D is a racing game, it has all the condition you have when driving a car. 
It interacts with player and in order to win you need to think, there is no longer a die rolling game, you need to think of the strategy 
to win the game. This provide player an atmosphere of tension since everyone want to win the game.
